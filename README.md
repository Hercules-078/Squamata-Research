Influence of biogeographic realm on global body size and reproductive variation in squamate reptiles.
---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates how body size (SVL) and clutch size vary across different biogeographic realms in Squamata (lizards and snakes). Using a large compiled dataset, we tested whether environmental gradients—especially latitude and temperature—influence morphological and reproductive traits. The study was designed to evaluate patterns predicted by Bergmann’s Rule and other ecogeographical principles.

 ##What We Did

Collected and cleaned morphological data (SVL), reproductive data (clutch size), and geographic realm categorizations.

Performed statistical analyses including:

ANOVA and post-hoc tests to compare SVL across realms

Correlation tests between SVL and clutch size within each realm

Plots and visualizations (boxplots, pairwise comparisons, realm-wise patterns)

Tested whether body size increases with latitude (Bergmann’s rule).

Examined whether clutch size scales with body size in different environments.

## Key Results

Significant variation in body size across realms.

Some realms showed larger-bodied species, consistent with Bergmann’s rule, while others did not follow the pattern clearly.

Clutch size showed weak-to-moderate correlations with SVL, varying by realm.

Overall, ecological pressures and evolutionary histories differ strongly between realms, producing mixed support for classical ecogeographic rules.

## Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that body size and reproductive traits in Squamata are shaped by a combination of ecological conditions and biogeographic history.
While some patterns align with Bergmann’s rule, the global dataset reveals no universal trend, suggesting that squamate evolution is influenced by both local adaptation and phylogenetic constraints.
