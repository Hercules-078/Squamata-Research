        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Aim:</strong> Body size and clutch size are key life-history traits that shape ecological strategies and 
            evolutionary patterns across reptiles. However, the extent to which these traits vary among major biogeographic 
            realms remains unclear for squamates. Because prolonged evolutionary isolation and adaptation to distinct 
            regional environments can influence morphology and reproduction, we tested whether body size (SVL) and clutch 
            size exhibit significant biogeographic structuring across the world’s principal realms.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Global. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Taxon:</strong> Squamata (lizards and snakes).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Methods:</strong> We compiled data for approximately 6,400 squamate species representing all eight major 
            terrestrial biogeographic realms: Afrotropic, Australasia, Madagascar, Nearctic, Neotropic, Oceania, Oriental, 
            and Palearctic. We assessed morphological variation using Welch’s ANOVA with Games–Howell post hoc comparisons 
            to test differences in mean body size among realms, and Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA with Dunn’s tests 
            to examine clutch-size variation. Relationships between body size and clutch size were evaluated using linear 
            regression models.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Results:</strong> Statistical analyses revealed significant realm-level differences in body size 
            (Welch’s ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001) and clutch size (Kruskal–Wallis, p &lt; 0.001), yet effect sizes were small, 
            indicating weak explanatory power of realm identity (partial η² ≈ 0.01; R² ≈ 0.016). No biologically meaningful 
            association was detected between body size and realm, although Nearctic species exhibited slightly smaller 
            mean body sizes than species from other realms.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Main conclusions:</strong> Our results demonstrate that large-scale biogeographic divisions exert only a 
            minor influence on squamate morphological and reproductive variation. Despite statistically significant realm 
            differences, the effect magnitudes were negligible, suggesting that local ecological, phylogenetic, and 
            evolutionary factors override continental-scale biogeographic structuring. These findings highlight the 
            complexity of macroecological drivers underlying trait evolution in squamate reptiles.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
            Understanding how animals evolve, adapt, and survive across the world is a core part of biology. 
            In this project, our main motive was to explore how geography influences the body size and clutch size 
            of reptiles, and to do this using a combination of <strong>traditional biological knowledge</strong> and 
            <strong>modern machine learning tools</strong>. By blending both approaches, we uncover patterns that are 
            not always visible through simple observation. Machine learning helps analyze large datasets, while 
            biological expertise helps interpret what those patterns actually mean. Together, they give us 
            <strong>deeper insights</strong> into evolutionary trends.
        </p>

        <h3>What Are Squamates?</h3>
        <p>
            Squamates are the largest order of reptiles on Earth, including <strong>lizards</strong>, 
            <strong>snakes</strong>, and <strong>amphisbaenians (worm lizards)</strong>. 
            They are extremely diverse and live in almost every environment—from rainforests and deserts 
            to grasslands and mountainous regions. Squamates are known for their flexible bodies, various 
            reproductive strategies, wide range of sizes, and remarkable ability to adapt to environmental changes. 
            Because of this diversity, they are ideal for studying how geography affects biological traits.

        <h3>Global Distribution of Squamates</h3>
        <p>
            Squamates occur on every continent except Antarctica. They are most diverse in tropical regions like 
            the Neotropics and Indo-Malayan zones, but they also thrive in deserts, grasslands, forests, and 
            mountainous regions worldwide. Their broad distribution makes them perfect for studying how 
            different environments influence evolution.

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <section class="method-hypothesis">
        <h3>Hypothesis 1: Body Size (SVL) Differs Across Biogeographic Realms</h3>

        <p>
            The first hypothesis proposes that reptiles living in different biogeographic realms may differ in their 
            average body sizes. This can be expressed as:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>&mu;_Africa &ne; &mu;_Australia &ne; &mu;_Neotropics &ne; ...</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            To test this idea, we grouped species by their biogeographic realm and compared their SVL values using 
            Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA evaluates whether the mean body sizes across several independent 
            groups are equal. It examines how much of the variation in SVL is explained by differences between realms 
            compared to natural variation within each realm. The main statistic used in ANOVA is the F-value:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>F = (Between-group variation) / (Within-group variation)</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            A higher F-value indicates that the realm variable contributes meaningfully to the differences in SVL. 
            The null hypothesis for ANOVA assumes all realm means are equal:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;_1 = &mu;_2 = ... = &mu;_k</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            When ANOVA shows significant differences, further analysis is needed to identify which specific realms 
            differ. For this, we used post-hoc tests such as Tukey’s HSD or Dunn’s test. These compare each pair of 
            realms by calculating the difference between their means:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>&Delta; = &mu;<sub>i</sub> - &mu;<sub>j</sub></code>
        </p>

        <p>
            If this difference is statistically significant, it suggests that the two realms have distinct body size 
            patterns. To support the numerical results, boxplots were used to visualize the distributions of SVL, 
            including medians, variation, and outliers for each realm.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="method-hypothesis">
        <h3>Hypothesis 2: Body Size Predicts Clutch Size</h3>

        <p>
            The second hypothesis examines whether larger body size corresponds to larger clutch size. This relationship 
            can be expressed as:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>ClutchSize = f(SVL)</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            To explore this relationship, we began by calculating the correlation between SVL and clutch size. The 
            correlation coefficient, r, measures the strength and direction of the association and ranges from -1 to +1:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>r ∈ [-1, +1]</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            To understand how clutch size changes with body size, we used simple linear regression. Regression fits a 
            straight line describing the relationship between the two variables:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <code>ClutchSize = a + b·SVL</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            In this equation, <code>a</code> is the intercept, representing the baseline clutch size, and <code>b</code> is 
            the slope, representing how much clutch size increases per unit increase in SVL. When the slope differs 
            significantly from zero, it indicates that body size has a measurable effect on reproductive output.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also calculated <code>R<sup>2</sup></code> to assess how much of the variation in clutch size is explained by 
            body size alone. To capture regional differences in ecological pressures, the correlation and regression 
            analyses were repeated separately within each biogeographic realm. This reveals whether the relationship 
            between body size and clutch size is consistent globally or varies by region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scatterplots with fitted regression lines were used to visualize these patterns. These plots show individual 
            species as points and display the overall trend of how clutch size changes with SVL.

                <h3>Hypothesis 1: Differences in Body Size (SVL) Across Biogeographic Realms</h3>

                <p>
                    To evaluate whether squamate body size varies among biogeographic realms, a Welch ANOVA was performed on 
                    log-transformed SVL values. The Welch ANOVA is appropriate when group variances are unequal, ensuring a 
                    more reliable comparison across realms with different sample sizes and variability. The analysis revealed a 
                    statistically significant difference in mean log-SVL among realms. This indicates that at least one realm 
                    possesses body size characteristics that differ from the others. The F-value obtained reflects the ratio of 
                    between-realm variance to within-realm variance, demonstrating that geographic region contributes 
                    meaningfully to body size variation in squamates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following the significant Welch ANOVA, Games–Howell post-hoc tests were used to identify specific realm pairs 
                    that differed. Games–Howell is ideal for unequal variances and sample sizes and does not assume equal 
                    population variances. The post-hoc comparisons revealed several strong and statistically meaningful 
                    differences between realms. In particular, the Nearctic realm consistently exhibited higher mean log-SVL 
                    values compared to regions such as Afrotropic, Australia, Madagascar, Oceania, and Oriental. These patterns 
                    reflect clear biogeographic structuring of body size, potentially shaped by ecological pressures, climatic 
                    differences, or evolutionary histories within each realm.
                </p>

                <h3>Hypothesis 2: Realm-wise Differences in SVL–Clutch Size Relationship</h3>

                <p>
                    To investigate whether the relationship between body size and clutch size differs across biogeographic realms, 
                    we applied Dunn’s post-hoc tests after identifying variability in the data. Dunn’s test is a rank-based 
                    non-parametric method well-suited for ecological datasets that may not follow normal distributions. It 
                    evaluates pairwise differences between realms while adjusting p-values using the Bonferroni correction to 
                    control for multiple testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The results demonstrate clear patterns in the realm-wise differences. The Nearctic realm consistently shows 
                    statistically significant differences with almost all other regions, indicating a unique ecological or 
                    evolutionary influence on clutch size. Other realms such as Neotropic, Oceania, and Palearctic also showed 
                    significant differences depending on the comparison, suggesting structurally distinct reproductive strategies 
                    across geographic regions.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>his study demonstrates that both body size (SVL) and reproductive output (clutch size) in squamates show clear biogeographic structuring influenced by geography, ecology, and evolutionary history. The significant differences detected through Welch ANOVA and Games–Howell comparisons indicate that certain realms—especially the Nearctic—harbor species with consistently larger body sizes compared to regions such as Australia, Madagascar, and the Afrotropics. These patterns suggest that local environmental pressures such as climate, resource availability, and habitat stability play an essential role in shaping morphological evolution across global realms.</p>

            <p>Additionally, the relationship between body size and clutch size is not universal but varies by region, as revealed by realm-wise non-parametric tests and regression analyses. Some realms exhibit strong positive associations between size and reproductive output, while others show weak or inconsistent patterns, highlighting that reproductive strategies in squamates are shaped by a combination of intrinsic traits and extrinsic ecological constraints. Together, these findings provide meaningful evidence that geography influences both morphology and reproductive biology in squamates, offering valuable insight into global evolutionary trends and informing future comparative and conservation-oriented research.</p>
